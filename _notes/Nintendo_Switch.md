## Audio coexistence with desktop for online chat  
- Sum up: Output Switch audio to a destop, then output both desktop and Switch audio with the desktop. So that you can play Switch along with Discord or other chat app in the desktop.  
- Requirement  
  - desktop with Win10 x1  
  - Switch x1  
  - 3.5mm male-to-male cable x1  
- Step  
  - Plug the 3.5mm cable to **Switch** and **rear audio input jack** of the desktop.  
  - Right click the **Speakers** icon on the taskbar and select **Sound (音效)**.  
  - In **Sound** window, select **Recording (錄製)** tab.  
  - In **Recording** tab, select **Line in at rear panel (Blue)** in the panel and check **Properties (內容)**.  
  - In **Line in at rear panel (Blue)** window, select **Listen (接聽)** tab and check **Listen to this device (聆聽此裝置)** then click **OK (確定)**.  
  - From now on there should be sound of Switch output from your desktop.  
- Trouble shooting  
  - There's buzz from Switch through the 3.5mm cable to the desktop  
    - Solution1: Prepare an **USB audio adapter**, plug it to the Switch dock and plug the cable in switch side to the adapter, then play Switch in docked mode.  
    - Solution2: Prepare a **Ground Loop Noise isolator**, place it between Switch and the desktop.
