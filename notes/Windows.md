# Notes-Windows  

## Shell environment
Install [git-for-windows](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/wiki/Technical-overview) instead of normal Git.  
Use the included bash for shell environment.  
```
The included bash in git-for-windows provides much friendly environment than one in normal Git, such as pacman support.
With pacman support, installing packages such as python is much easier.
When using vim plugins such as jedi-vim, this is helpful compared to python installed from website or microsoft store.
